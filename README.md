# SnakeGame

A very simple yet amazing snake game that reminds you of the game you played in feature phones.
This java project uses ```ActionListener``` interface, which is used for the arrow keys to change the direction of snake.


We can basically move in the directions, Right, Left, Up and Down

It displays the score and "Game Over" when the snake either collides with itself or any of the walls.
